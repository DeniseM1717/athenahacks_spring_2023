  <td><b>Roth IRA : </b>
    <br>  If you don’t have anyone in your life to ask for financial advice, 
    then you probably haven’t heard of Roth IRA’s. 
    That’s a problem because Roth IRA’s are the best place to store your long-term savings. 
    Although banks are great for your emergency and short-term savings, 
    they can only give you 1-4% of returns from interest every year. 
    That barely keeps up with inflation! By using a Roth IRA,
    you can begin to invest your money into the stock market and get an average of 10% returns on your money. 
    Let your money grow with you! The most important advantage of Roth IRAs is that you pay taxes on your money NOW. 
    Chances are, you’re in a lower tax bracket now than you will be when you’re 60 years old, so pay those taxes while you’re young!
